# Sample news app

This is a sample app that demonstrates how to simulate two stack navigation screens using tab navigation.

## Why

This app contains three screens: feed screen, article screen and comments screen. There is a webview on the comments screen in which Disqus-comments will be loaded on first-time visit.

Comments screen will be loaded every time if use stack navigator. So I was put Article and Comments screens into tab navigator.
